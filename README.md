# rest-api
 
### Usage
In the project directory, first run:

#### `npm install`

This will download all the projects dependencies listed in the package.json files and install them locally. If you're unfamiliar with npm, you might want to visit
https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/
for further reference.


#### `npm start`

Runs the app on the server http://localhost:5000. Since this project is really just an API and not displayed in the browser it is recommended to use a software like https://www.postman.com/ if you want to test different requests and routes.
